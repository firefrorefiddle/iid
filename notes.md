# Changes from original design

- As discussed with Mike, instead of clicking hinzufugen twice, we'll just have the fields ready to be filled, submitted only on Hinzufugen (R.)
- I've added the date picker, more to come (R.)
- made the hinzuf√ºgen link into a submit button as it seems more common to me (M.)
- don't check for description when adding rows. this is to be debated, but I don't see why it would always be necessary, cause the category might explain enough (M.)

# TODO

- Modal searches + their respective UIs
- Completion of base UI
- add consistent date formatting

# DONE

- Add input validation (M.)
